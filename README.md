# Quantum Nexus 🌀

A quantum physics-inspired browser game where you navigate a particle through quantum fields while avoiding obstacles and reaching targets.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click "START QUANTUM SIMULATION" to begin
3. Navigate your quantum particle to the green target while avoiding red obstacles
4. Use quantum abilities to overcome challenges

## 🎯 Objective

- Reach the green target to complete each level
- Avoid red obstacles that cause quantum decoherence
- Collect powerups to enhance your abilities
- Progress through increasingly difficult levels

## 🎮 Controls

### Movement
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move your quantum particle
- **Mouse**: Target location for teleportation

### Quantum Abilities
- **Q**: Quantum Tunneling (Teleport)
- **W**: Time Dilation (Slow time)
- **E**: Quantum Shield (Protection)
- **R**: Superposition (Create clones)
- **T**: Electromagnetic Field (Attract powerups)
- **Y**: Phase Shift (Pass through obstacles)
- **U**: Quantum Entanglement (Special effect)
- **I**: Wave Function Collapse (Destroy nearby obstacles)

### System
- **ESC**: Pause/Resume game

## 🌟 Features

- **8 Unique Abilities**: Each with cooldowns and energy costs
- **3 Difficulty Levels**: Quantum, Relativistic, and Singularity
- **Progressive Difficulty**: More obstacles and challenges each level
- **Particle Effects**: Beautiful visual effects and animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🎨 Game Elements

### Player
- Cyan quantum particle with wave function visualization
- Trail effect showing quantum uncertainty
- Shield and clone effects when abilities are active

### Obstacles
- Red quantum barriers that cause decoherence
- Rotating and pulsing animations
- Can be collapsed using Wave Function Collapse ability

### Powerups
- **Energy** (Cyan): Restore quantum energy
- **Shield** (Yellow): Temporary protection
- **Speed** (Orange): Increase coherence

### Target
- Green quantum target with pulsing effect
- Sometimes phases in/out of existence

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. No installation or setup required!

## 🎵 Game Mechanics

- **Quantum Energy**: Powers your abilities (regenerates over time)
- **Coherence**: Your quantum stability (affects performance)
- **Time Dilation**: Slow down time to navigate precisely
- **Quantum Uncertainty**: Slight random movement adds realism
- **Progressive Scoring**: Higher scores for completing harder levels

## 🏆 Difficulty Levels

- **Quantum**: 3 obstacles, 3 powerups (Beginner)
- **Relativistic**: 5 obstacles, 2 powerups (Intermediate)
- **Singularity**: 8 obstacles, 1 powerup (Expert)

## 🎯 Tips for Success

1. Manage your quantum energy carefully
2. Use Time Dilation for precise navigation
3. Collect powerups to maintain your abilities
4. Phase Shift through obstacles when trapped
5. Create clones to confuse obstacle patterns
6. Use Wave Function Collapse as a last resort
